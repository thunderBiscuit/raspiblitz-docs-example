# Workshop Scenario A) Provide a Ready-2-Go RaspiBlitz

_Estimated Duration: 2 Hours_

Sure, one part of the fun for participants is to assemble the hardware themselves. But if you aim for the shortest workshop possible, then this is the way to go (around 2 hours length). If you have the RaspiBlitz already assembled to be operational at the workshop you should already set them up with a basic setup, maybe even transfer a small amount of coins onto them. This way you can give the workshop participants the A.B.C.D passwords on a sheet of paper and let them jump right into learning how to manage a node. While waiting for confirmations on the first channel opening you can use the time to explain how to build a RaspiBlitz from scratch and some Lightning basics.

These are the following steps you need to prepare (follow links for details):

- [Buy all the Hardware](WORKSHOP.md#buy-all-the-hardware)
- [Assemble all the Hardware](WORKSHOP.md#assemble-all-the-hardware)
- [Prepare HDDs with Blockchain Data](WORKSHOP.md#prepare-hdds-with-blockchain-data)
- [Prepare SD cards with latest RaspiBlitz image](WORKSHOP.md#prepare-sd-cards-with-latest-raspiblitz-image)
- Run Basic Node Setup
- [Setup Workshop Environment](WORKSHOP.md#setup-workshop-environment)

_NOTE: Make sure that the blockchain of the RaspiBlitzes are synced before the workshop begins._

# Workshop Scenario B) Provide a RaspiBlitz Hardware-Kit

_Estimated Duration: 3 Hours_


In this workshop scenario you buy all the hardware but let participants assemble the RaspiBlitz themselves - that's half the fun and people get a feel for the gear. But to keep the blockchain sync time short and be able to keep in a 3 hour timeframe you need to prepare the HDDs with blockchain data not much older than one day. Start ordering the parts at least one week before the workshop (budget as needed) and plan the day before completely for copying blockchain data to all those HDDs.


These are the following steps you need to prepare (follow links for details):

- [Buy all the Hardware](WORKSHOP.md#buy-all-the-hardware)
- [Prepare HDDs with Blockchain Data](WORKSHOP.md#prepare-hdds-with-blockchain-data)
- [Prepare SD cards with latest RaspiBlitz image](WORKSHOP.md#prepare-sd-cards-with-latest-raspiblitz-image)
- [Setup Workshop Environment](WORKSHOP.md#setup-workshop-environment)

Variation: If you don't have a big bugdet to prefinance the parts or people have already hardware they want to bring you can just buy the HDDs and SD cards and prepare them to run this scenario.


# Workshop Scenario C) Bring your own Hardware


_Estimated Duration: 4â€“6 Hours_

This scenario is advised only for small groups, or you'll need to bring multiple blockchain copy stations - see details on "Prepare HDDs with Blockchain Data". Otherwise it needs the least prepartion time and prefinance and can be announced to participants about 5 days beforehand, so that they have time to order all the parts online.

- [Prepare Blockchain Copy Station](WORKSHOP.md#prepare-blockchain-copy-station)
- [Setup Workshop Environment](WORKSHOP.md#setup-workshop-environment)


As soon as the participants arrive at the workhop, make sure to check their hardware list. We also suggest taking their HDDs and starting the blockchain copy process before official starting time.
