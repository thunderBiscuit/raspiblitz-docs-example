# RaspiBlitz Workshop Tutorial

One goal of the RaspiBlitz project is to provide an open DIY platform for workshops - to setup your own lightning node and learn to manage it. This tutorial is collecting best practices on how to organise a RaspiBlitz workshop.

# Time Planning

First thing on planning a RaspiBlitz workshop is to calculate the time needed correctly. For example, the setup from scratch with no further support is still a weekend project - mostly because downloading and syncing the blockchain takes a lot of time.


So the time required for the workshop all depends on the preparation you as a workshop organizer are interested to provide ahead of the workshop. This document outlines three starting configurations... going from most preparation required to least.

Note that the time estimates below are about getting a node to a "clean setup". They do not include the funding & setting up channels process - which is adding an additional 30 min to 1 hour to the calculation.


Also, if your group is lager then 5 participants, calculate some extra time for individual support. You can compensate for that if you let two participants work together on one RaspiBlitz setup; this way you limit individual support and let them help each other.
