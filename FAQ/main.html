(LEGACY)</h2> <p>If your old RaspiBlitz if version 0.98 or higher, just follow the update instructions in the README.</p> <p>If you run a version earlier then 0.98 you basically need to setup a new RaspiBlitz to update - but you can keep the blockchain data on the HDD, so you don't need have that long waiting time again:</p> <ol><li><p>Close all open lightning channels you have (<code>lncli closeallchannels --force</code>) or use the menu option 'CLOSE ALL' if available.

But then the scripts would need to be written in a much more complex way to be able to work with any versions of LND and Bitcoind (they are already complex enough with all the edge cases) and testing would become even more time consuming than it is now already. That's nothing a single developer can deliver.</p> <p>For some, it might be a pain point to make an update by re-burning a new sd card - especially if you added your own scripts or made changes to the system - but that's by design. It's a way to enforce a &quot;clean state&quot; with every update - the same state that I tested and developed the scripts with. The reason for that pain: I simply cannot write and support scripts that run on every modified system forever - that's simply too much work.</p> <p>With the SD card update mechanism I reduce complexity, I deliver a &quot;clean state&quot; OS, LND/Bitcoind and the scripts tightly bundled together exactly in the dependency/combination like I tested them and it's much easier to reproduce bug reports and give support that way.</p> <p>Of course, people should modify the system, add own scripts, etc ... but if you want to also have the benefit of the updates of the RaspiBlitz, you have two ways to do it:</p> <ol><li><p>Contribute your changes back to the main project as pull requests so that they become part of the next update - the next SD card release.</p></li> <li><p>Make your changes so that they survive an SD card update easily - put all your scripts and extra data onto the HDD AND document for yourself how to activate them again after an update .. maybe even write a small shell script (stored on your HDD) that installs &amp; configures all your additional packages, software and scripts.</p></li></ol> <p><em>BTW there is a beneficial side effect when updating with a new SD card: You also get rid of any malware or system bloat that happened in the past.

Check the options <code>Copying from another Computer</code> &amp; <code>Cloning from a 2nd HDD</code> described in the <a href="/raspiblitz-docs-example/FAQ/" class="router-link-active">README</a> for more details.</p> <h2 id="i-have-the-full-blockchain-on-another-computer-how-do-i-copy-it-to-the-raspiblitz"><a href="#i-have-the-full-blockchain-on-another-computer-how-do-i-copy-it-to-the-raspiblitz" class="header-anchor">#</a> I have the full blockchain on another computer. How do I copy it to the RaspiBlitz?</h2> <p>Copying a already synced blockchain from another computer (for example your Laptop) can be a quick way to get the RaspiBlitz started or replacing a corrupted blockchain with a fresh one. Also that way you synced and verified the blockchain yourself and not trusting the RaspiBlitz Torrent downloads (don't trust, verify).</p> <p>One requirement is that the blockchain is from another bitcoin-core client with version greater or equal to 0.17.1.</p> <p>But we don't copy the data via USB to the device, because the HDD needs to be formatted in EXT4 and that is usually not read/writable by Windows or Mac computers. So I will explain a way to copy the data through your local network. This should work from Windows, Mac, Linux and even from another already synced RaspiBlitz.</p> <p>Both computers (your RaspberryPi and the other computer with the full blockchain on) need to be connected to the same local network. Make sure that bitcoin is stopped on the computer containing the blockchain. If your blockchain source is another RaspiBlitz run on the terminal <code>sudo systemctl stop bitcoind</code> and then go to the directory where the blockchain data is with <code>cd /mnt/hdd/bitcoin</code> - when copy/transfer is done later reboot a RaspiBlitz source with <code>sudo shutdown -r now</code>.</p> <p>If everything of the above is prepared, start the setup of the new RaspiBlitz with a fresh SD card (like explained in the README) - it's OK that there is no blockchain data on your HDD yet - just follow the setup. When you get to the setup-point <code>Getting the Blockchain</code> choose the COPY option. Starting from version 1.0 of the RaspiBlitz this will give you further detailed instructions how to transfer the blockchain data onto your RaspiBlitz. In short: On your computer with the blockchain data source you will execute SCP commands, that will copy the data over your Local Network to your RaspiBlitz.</p> <p>Once you finished all the transfers the Raspiblitz will make a quick-check on the data - but that will not guarantee that everything in detail was OK with the transfer. Check further FAQ answers if you get stuck or see a final sync with a value below 90%.</p> <h2 id="how-do-i-generate-a-debug-report"><a href="#how-do-i-generate-a-debug-report" class="header-anchor">#</a> How do I generate a Debug Report?</h2> <p>If your RaspiBlitz is not working right and you like to get help from the community, it's good to provide more debug information, so other can better diagnose your problem - please follow the following steps to generate a debug report:</p> <ul><li>ssh into your raspiblitz as admin user with your password A</li> <li>If you see the menu - use CTRL+C to get to the terminal</li> <li>To generate debug report run: <code>./XXdebugLogs.sh</code></li> <li>Then copy all output beginning with <code>*** RASPIBLITZ LOGS ***</code> and share this</li></ul> <p><em>PLEASE NOTICE: It's possible that this logs can contain private information (like IPs, node IDs, ...) - just share publicly what you feel OK with.</em></p> <h2 id="why-is-my-final-sync-taking-so-long"><a href="#why-is-my-final-sync-taking-so-long" class="header-anchor">#</a> Why is my &quot;final sync&quot; taking so long?</h2> <p>First of all if you see a final sync over 90% and you can see from time to time small increase - you should be OK ... this can take some looong time to catch up with the network. Only in the case that you actively choose the <code>SYNC</code> option in the <code>Getting the Blockchain</code> a final sync under 90% is OK. If you did a torrent or a copy from another computer and seeing under 90% something went wrong and the setup process is ignoring your prepared Blockchain and doing a full sync - which can almost take forever on a raspberryPi.</p> <p>So if something is wrong (like mentioned above) then try again from the beginning. You need to reset your HDD for a fresh start: SSH in as admin user. Abort the final sync info with CTRL+c to get to the terminal. There run <code>sudo /home/admin/XXcleanHDD.sh -all</code> and follow the script to delete all data in HDD. When finished power down with <code>sudo shutdown now</code>. Then make a fresh SD card from image and this time try another option to get the blockchain. If you run into trouble the second time, please report an issue on GitHub.</p> <h2 id="how-to-backup-my-lightning-node"><a href="#how-to-backup-my-lightning-node" class="header-anchor">#</a> How to backup my Lightning Node?</h2> <p>There are two ways of Backup:</p> <h3 id="_1-securing-your-on-chain-and-channel-funds-during-operation"><a href="#_1-securing-your-on-chain-and-channel-funds-during-operation" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1) Securing your On-Chain- and Channel-Funds during Operation</h3> <p>This is best done by auto backing-up the 'channel.backup' file to a remote location. But it just secures the funds you have in your on-chain wallet or in your channels. On recovery the channels will get closed. For details on how to setup see the README:
https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/blob/v1.2/README.md#backup-for-on-chain---channel-funds</p> <h3 id="_2-making-a-complete-lnd-data-backup"><a href="#_2-making-a-complete-lnd-data-backup" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2) Making a complete LND data backup</h3> <p>This backups all your LND data - including all open channels. But it's just intended to use when you move your LND data between computers, during update situations or in rescue recoveries, because replaying out-dated backups can lead to the loss of all channel funds.</p> <p>How to backup LND data in a rescue situation see next question &quot;How can I recover my coins from a failing RaspiBlitz?&quot;.</p> <h2 id="how-can-i-recover-my-coins-from-a-failing-raspiblitz"><a href="#how-can-i-recover-my-coins-from-a-failing-raspiblitz" class="header-anchor">#</a> How can I recover my coins from a failing RaspiBlitz?</h2> <p>On a RaspiBlitz you have coins in your on-chain wallet (bitcoin wallet) and also coins in lightning channels. First we will try to recover all of them and even trying to keep your channels open with &quot;Recover LND data&quot;. This that is not possible you can fall back to the second option &quot;Recover from Wallet Seed&quot;.</p> <h3 id="_1-recover-lnd-data"><a href="#_1-recover-lnd-data" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1) Recover LND data</h3> <p>Best to recover all your LND data/channels is when you still can SSH into the RaspiBlitz and the HDD is still usable/reachable (mounted) - even it shows some errors. If this is not possible anymore you should skip to the second option &quot;Recover from Wallet Seed&quot; or try to recover the LND data from the HDD (directory <code>lnd</code>) from another computer.</p> <p>If you still can SSH in and HDD is readable, we can try to rescue/export your LND data (funds and channels) from a RaspiBlitz to then be able to restore it back to a fresh one. For this you can use the following procedure ...</p> <p>To rescue/export your Lightning data from a RaspiBlitz (since v1.1):</p> <ul><li>SSH into your RaspiBlitz and EXIT to terminal from the menu.</li> <li>then run: <code>/home/admin/config.scripts/lnd.rescue.sh backup</code></li> <li>follow the instructions of the script.</li></ul> <p>This will create a lnd-rescue file (ends on gz.tar) that contains all the data from the LND. The script offers you a command to transfer the lnd-rescue file to your laptop. If the transfer was successful you can now setup a fresh RaspiBlitz. Do all the setup until you have a clean new Lightning node running - just without any funding or channels.</p> <p>Then to restore your old LND data and to recover your funds and channels:</p> <ul><li>SSH into your new RaspiBlitz and EXIT to terminal from the menu.</li> <li>then run: <code>/home/admin/config.scripts/lnd.rescue.sh restore</code></li> <li>follow the instructions of the script.</li></ul> <p>This script will offer you a way to transfer the lnd-rescue file from your laptop to the new RaspiBlitz and will restore the old data. LND gets then restarted for you and after some time it should show you the status screen again with your old funds and channels.</p> <p><strong>Be aware that if backup is some hours old, channels could have been closed by the other party and it may take some time until you see funds back on-chain. If backup is somewhat older then 1 day also the channel counter parties may have used your offline time to cheat you with an old state. And if your backup was not the latest state it could also been happening that you are posting an old channel state (seen as cheating) and funds of that channel get lost as punishment. So again .. this backup method can be risky, use with caution. But it's recommended to try in recover and rescue situations - it's not for regular backups.</strong></p> <h3 id="_2-recover-from-wallet-seed"><a href="#_2-recover-from-wallet-seed" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2) Recover from Wallet Seed</h3> <p>Remember those 24 words you were writing down during the setup? That's your &quot;cipher seed&quot; - now this words are important to recover your wallet. If you don't have them anymore: go back to option &quot;Recover LND data&quot; (see above) and check all possible ways to recover data from the HDD. If you still have the word seed: good, but read the following carefully:</p> <p>With the word seed you can recover the on-chain funds that LND was managing for you - but it does not contain all the details about the channels you have open - it's mostly the key to your funding wallet. If you were able to close all channels or never opened any channels, then everything should be OK and the best results to recover on-chain funds from wallet seeds are reported to get from installing the Lightning Labs App on your laptop and use the wallet seed (and same wallet passwords): https://github.com/lightninglabs/lightning-app/releases Also people reported to be able to recover their on-chain funds with the Zap Desktop wallet (OSX, Win, Linux): https://zap.jackmallers.com/download</p> <p>If you had open channels it would be best to check if you have also the <code>channel.backup</code> file (Static-Channel-Backup feature) that is available since LND 0.6 (RaspiBlitz v1.2) and use that in the process below ... for more details on the <code>channel.backup</code> file see <a href="/raspiblitz-docs-example/FAQ/#backup-for-on-chain---channel-funds">README.md on backups</a>.</p> <ul><li>SetUp a fresh RaspiBlitz (fresh SD-Card image and clean HDD).</li> <li>During the new SetUp you get to the point of creating the LND wallet (see image below).</li> <li>Choose <code>OLD - I had a old Node I want to recover/restore</code>  option and then</li> <li>Choose <code>SEED+SCB - Seed &amp; channel.backup file</code> option</li> <li>and follow the instructions to upload your <code>channel.backup</code> file and enter your seed</li></ul> <p>Then give LND some time to re-scan the blockchain. In the end you will have restored your funding wallet. You maybe need to wait for your old channel counter parts to force close the old channels until you see the coins back displayed.</p> <p>If you don't have the <code>channel.backup</code> file and only the seed words there is another last hope to try - read this article:

If it's really happening out of the blue - check your local network setup for a second. Maybe the local IP of your RaspiBlitz changed? Is there a second RaspiBlitz connected? It's a security warning, so at least take some time to check if anything is strange. But also don't get to panic - when it's in your local network, normally it's some network thing - not an intruder.</p> <p>To fix this and to be able to login with SSH again, you have to remove the old public key for that IP from your local client computer. Just run the following command (with the replaced IP of your RaspiBlitz): <code>ssh-keygen -R IP-OF-YOUR-RASPIBLITZ</code> or remove the line for this IP manually from the known_hosts file (see the path to the file in the warning message).</p> <p>After that, you should be able to login with SSH again.</p> <h2 id="when-using-auto-unlock-how-much-security-do-i-lose"><a href="#when-using-auto-unlock-how-much-security-do-i-lose" class="header-anchor">#</a> When using Auto-Unlock, how much security do I lose?</h2> <p>The idea of the &quot;wallet lock&quot; in general, is that your private key / seed / wallet is stored in a encrypted way on your HDD. On every restart, you have to input the password once manually (unlock your wallet), so that the LND can read and write to the encrypted wallet again. This improves your security if your RaspiBlitz gets stolen or taken away - it loses power and then your wallet is safe - the attacker cannot access your wallet.</p> <p>When you activate the &quot;Auto-Unlock&quot; feature of the RaspiBlitz, the password of the wallet gets stored on the RaspiBlitz.

The safest way is always to SSH into the RaspiBlitz and use the &quot;POWER OFF&quot; option in the main menu.</p> <p>But if cannot login with SSH and you need to power off at least remove the LAN cable (network connection)first for sometime (around 10-30 secs - until you can see no more blinking lights on the HDD) and then remove the power cable.

Prepare like in <a href="/raspiblitz-docs-example/FAQ/#build-the-sd-card-image">Build the SD Card Image</a> from the README but in the end run the command:</p></li></ul> <p>`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[GITHUB-USERNAME]/raspiblitz/[BRANCH]/build_sdcard.sh &amp;&amp; sudo bash build_sdcard.sh [BRANCH] [GITHUB-USERNAME]</p> <p>If you are then working in your forked repo and want to update the scripts on your RaspiBlitz with your latest repo changes, run <code>/home/admin/XXsyncScripts.sh</code> - that's OK as long as you don't make changes to the sd card build script - then you would need to build a fresh sd card again from your repo.</p> <h2 id="how-can-i-checkout-a-new-branch-from-the-raspiblitz-repo-to-my-forked-repo"><a href="#how-can-i-checkout-a-new-branch-from-the-raspiblitz-repo-to-my-forked-repo" class="header-anchor">#</a> How can I checkout a new branch from the RaspiBlitz repo to my forked repo?</h2> <p>You need to have your forked repo checked out on your laptop. There your should see your forked repo as <code>origin</code>, when you run <code>git remote -v</code>. If you don't see a additional <code>upstream</code> remote yet, then it with the following command <code>git remote add upstream https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz.git</code>.</p> <p>So first checkout the new branch named <code>BRANCH</code> from the original RaspBlitz repo to your local computer with: <code>git fetch upstream</code> and then <code>git checkout -b BRANCH upstream/BRANCH</code>.</p> <p>Now push the new branch to your forked GitHub repo with <code>git push -u origin BRANCH</code>.</p> <p>Once the branch is available and synced between the RaspiBlitz GitHub repo, your forked GitHub repo and your local computer git repo, you can start developing.</p> <h2 id="how-can-i-sync-a-branch-of-my-forked-with-my-local-raspiblitz"><a href="#how-can-i-sync-a-branch-of-my-forked-with-my-local-raspiblitz" class="header-anchor">#</a> How can I sync a branch of my forked with my local RaspiBlitz?</h2> <p>You need to know that there is a git copy of the original RaspiBlitz GitHub repo on your physical RaspiBlitz in the folder <code>/home/admin/raspiblitz</code>. If you change into that folder and run <code>git remote -v</code> you can see the set origin repo.</p> <p>You need to change that origin repo to your forked repo. You do that with:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>git remote set-url origin [THE-URL-OF-YOUR-FORKED-REPO]

This can lead to data loss/corruption on the HDD. If you see those just one or two times that's not OK, but can be in a tolerant window. Nevertheless it make sure your USB power adapter can deliver at least 3A (big and stable is good). If you still see those warnings maybe get a second USB Power adapter just for the HDD and power the HDD through a Y-Cable - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-cable#USB or put a USB Hub with extra power between the raspberry and the HDD.</p> <h2 id="why-do-we-need-to-download-the-blockchain-and-not-syncing-it"><a href="#why-do-we-need-to-download-the-blockchain-and-not-syncing-it" class="header-anchor">#</a> Why do we need to download the blockchain and not syncing it?</h2> <p><em>For RaspberryPi 3:</em> The RaspiBlitz is powered by the RaspberryPi. The processing power of this SingleBoardComputer is too low to make a fast sync of the blockchain from the bitcoin peer to peer network during setup process (validation). To sync and index the complete blockchain could take weeks or even longer. That's why the RaspiBlitz needs to download a prepared blockchain from another source.</p> <p><em>For RaspberryPi 4 and above:</em> The RaspberryPi is now fast enough and with 2GB RAM and a SSD self syncing and validation is the new default.</p> <h2 id="is-using-the-prepared-sd-card-image-secure"><a href="#is-using-the-prepared-sd-card-image-secure" class="header-anchor">#</a> Is using the prepared SD card image secure?</h2> <p>Using pre-built software almost always shifts trust to the one who made the binary. But at least you can check with the SHA checksum after download if the image downloaded is really the one offered by the GitHub Repo. To do so make a quick check if your browser is really in the correct GiutHub page and that your HTTPS of the GitHub page is signed by 'DigiCert'. Then compare the SHA-256 string (always next to the download link of the image on the README) with the result of the command <code>shasum -a 256 [DOWNLOADED-FILE-TO-CHECK]</code> (Mac/Linux). Still this is not optimal and if at least some people from the community request it, I will consider signing the download as an author for the future.</p> <p>The best way would be to build the sd card yourself. You use the script <code>build_sdcard.sh</code> for it. Take some minutes to check if you see anything suspicious in that build script and then follow the <a href="/raspiblitz-docs-example/FAQ/#build-the-sd-card-image">README</a> on this.</p> <h2 id="is-downloading-the-blockchain-from-a-third-party-secure"><a href="#is-downloading-the-blockchain-from-a-third-party-secure" class="header-anchor">#</a> Is downloading the blockchain from a third party secure?</h2> <p>To download a blockchain from a third party (torrent) is not optimal and for the future with more cheap &amp; powerfull SingleBoardComputers we could get rid of this 'patch'.</p> <p>The downloaded blockchain is pre-indexed and pre-validated. That should be practically secure enough, because if the user gets a &quot;manipulated&quot; blockchain it would not work after setup. The beginning of the downloaded blockchain needs to fit the genesis block (in bitcoind software) and the end of the downloaded blockchain needs not match with the rest of the bitcoin network state - hashes of new block distributed within the peer-2-peer network need to match the downloaded blockchain head. So if you downloaded a manipulated blockchain it simply wouldn't work in practice. As long as you are not in a totally hostile environment where someone would be able to fake a whole network of peers and miners around you - this is secure enough for running a small funded full node to try out the lightning network.</p> <p>If you don't trust the download or you want to run the RaspiBlitz in a more production like setup (on your own risk) then don't use the torrent download and choose the option to COPY the blockchain data from a more powerful computer (laptop or desktop) where you synced, verified and indexed the blockchain all by your yourself - see <a href="/raspiblitz-docs-example/FAQ/#4-copying-from-another-computer">README</a> for more details.</p> <h2 id="why-is-taking-my-torrent-download-of-the-blockchain-so-long"><a href="#why-is-taking-my-torrent-download-of-the-blockchain-so-long" class="header-anchor">#</a> Why is taking my torrent download of the blockchain so long?</h2> <p>Other users reported that opening up and forwarding the following port from their router to the RaspiBlitz helped speed up and getting started the torrent download: 49200-49250</p> <p>On details how to set port forwarding on your router model see: https://portforward.com</p> <h2 id="what-is-the-base-torrent-file"><a href="#what-is-the-base-torrent-file" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is the &quot;Base Torrent File&quot;?</h2> <p>Inspired by the website getbitcoinblockchain.com we use one of their base torrent files to have a basic set of blocks - those blocks will not change for the future. This torrent contains most of the data (the big file) and we dont need to change the torrent for a long time. This way the torrent can get establish a wide spread seeding and the torrent network can take the heavy load.</p> <p>At the moment (Baseiteration=2) this is just the bitcoin blk and rev files up to the number:
blockchain/blocks/blk00000.dat - blk01357.dat
blockchain/blocks/rev00000.dat - rev01357.dat
(no testnet data)</p> <p>For litecoin (Baseiteration=2) it's blk and rev files up to the number:
blockchain/blocks/blk00000.dat - blk00150.dat
blockchain/blocks/rev00000.dat - rev00150.dat</p> <p>The base torrent file should always have the following naming scheme:</p> <p><code>raspiblitz-[CHAINNETWORK][BASEITERATIONNUMBER]-[YEAR]-[MONTH]-[DAY]-base.torrent</code></p> <p>So for example the second version of the base torrent for litecoin created on 2018-10-31 would have this name: raspiblitz-litecoin2-2018-10-31-base.torrent</p> <h2 id="what-is-the-update-torrent-file-and-how-to-create-it"><a href="#what-is-the-update-torrent-file-and-how-to-create-it" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is the &quot;Update Torrent File&quot; and how to create it?</h2> <p>All the rest of the blocks and needed files get packaged into a second torrent file. This file will be updated much more often. The seeding is expected to be not that good and download may be slower, but that's OK because it's a much smaller file.</p> <p>This way a good balance between good seeding and up-to-date blockchain can be reached.</p> <p>To create the Update Torrent file, follow the following step ...</p> <p>Have a almost 100% synced bitcoind MAINNET on a RaspiBlitz
(if you have funds in there, make a backup first and calculate for about 1 day of off-time to repair the blockchain after this)</p> <p>Stop bitcoind with:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>sudo systemctl stop bitcoind
</code></pre></div><p>Delete base torrent files:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>sudo rm /mnt/hdd/bitcoin/blocks/blk00*.dat
sudo rm /mnt/hdd/bitcoin/blocks/blk0{1000..1357}.dat
sudo rm /mnt/hdd/bitcoin/blocks/rev00*.dat
sudo rm /mnt/hdd/bitcoin/blocks/rev0{1000..1357}.dat
</code></pre></div><p>Now change to your computer where you package the torrent files and transfer the two directories into your torrent base directory (should be your current working directory):</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>mkdir ./blockchain
scp -r bitcoin@[RaspiBlitzIP]:/mnt/hdd/bitcoin/blocks ./blockchain/blocks
scp -r bitcoin@[RaspiBlitzIP]:/mnt/hdd/bitcoin/chainstate ./blockchain/chainstate
</code></pre></div><p>(Re-)name the &quot;torrent base directory&quot; to the same name as the torrent UPDATE file itself later (without the .torrent ending). The updated torrent file should always have the following naming schema:</p> <p><code>raspiblitz-[CHAINNETWORK][BASEITERATIONNUMBER]-[YEAR]-[MONTH]-[DAY]-update.torrent</code></p> <p><em>So for example an update torrent created on 2018-12-24 for litecoin that is an update to the second base torrent version would have this name: raspiblitz-litecoin2-2018-12-24-update.torrent</em></p> <p>Now open your torrent client (e.g. qTorrent for OSX) and create a new torrent-file with the freshly renamed &quot;torrent base directory&quot; as source directory.</p> <p>Add this list of trackers to your torrent and start seeding (keep a free/empty line between the three single trackers):</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>udp://tracker.justseed.it:1337
